# Breast Cancer Detection

This project uses machine learning techniques to detect and classify breast cancer based on images. The model has been trained and tested using TensorFlow and Keras. The application is hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/manavg23/BreastCancerDetection).

## Project Overview

The project includes the following components:
- **Model Training**: The model is trained to classify breast cancer images into various categories based on density and malignancy.
- **Model Loading and Deployment**: The trained model is saved and loaded for prediction.
- **Web Interface**: A web interface is created using Gradio for user interaction with the model.

## Files and Directories

- `app.py`: Main application script that loads the model, preprocesses input images, and sets up the Gradio interface.
- `model/`: Directory where the trained model is saved as `model.h5`.
- `model.py`: Contains functions for downloading and saving the model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BreastCancerDetection.git
   cd BreastCancerDetection
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Model**

   Ensure that your trained model is saved in the `model/` directory as `model.h5`.

2. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start a local server and open the Gradio interface in your browser.

## Gradio Interface

- **Input**: Upload an image of the breast cancer scan.
- **Output**: The model will classify the image and display the probability for each class.
